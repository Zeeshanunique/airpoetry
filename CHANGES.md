# Enhanced Animation and Page Transitions

## Overview
This update adds smooth page transitions and enhanced animations throughout the application to create a more engaging and polished user experience. The animations are designed to reflect the ecological theme of the project, with floating elements that evoke air and nature, and dynamic background imagery related to air pollution, AI, and ecology.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced PageTransition Component
- Improved the PageTransition component with nested animations for smoother transitions
- Implemented using Framer Motion's AnimatePresence for coordinated entry/exit animations
- Added scale effects for more dynamic page changes
- Updated App.js to properly handle route transitions with location keys

### 2. Transformed LandingPage Component
- Added rotating background image carousel featuring pollution, AI, and ecological imagery
- Implemented dynamic particles that change appearance based on the current theme
- Added floating ecological and AI elements (leaves, clouds, wind, CPU, database icons)
- Created animated data visualizations for air quality and AI networks
- Enhanced color scheme with dark theme for better contrast with visual elements
- Added staggered animations for content sections
- Enhanced hover effects on interactive elements
- Implemented backdrop blur effects for depth and readability

### 3. Enhanced AboutUs Component
- Integrated PageTransition component
- Added animated background elements
- Implemented staggered animations for team cards and project information
- Added subtle hover effects on cards and list items
- Improved visual hierarchy with motion

### 4. Enhanced Contacts Component
- Integrated PageTransition component
- Added animated background elements
- Improved form field animations with sequential entry
- Enhanced hover effects on links and buttons
- Added staggered animations for contact information sections

## Technical Implementation
- Used Framer Motion's variants for coordinated animations
- Implemented useEffect hooks for responsive particle generation and theme-based animations
- Created dynamic animation controls that respond to background image changes
- Used CSS backdrop filters for depth and layering
- Implemented spring animations for interactive elements
- Created reusable animation patterns across components
- Optimized animations with the `viewport` prop to trigger only when elements are visible
- Used `whileHover` and `whileTap` for interactive feedback

## Benefits
- Creates a more immersive and engaging user experience
- Reinforces the project themes through visual storytelling
- Provides visual context for the relationship between pollution, AI, and ecology
- Improves perceived performance with smoother transitions
- Provides better visual feedback for interactive elements
- Maintains consistent animation patterns across the application
- Enhances the emotional impact of the environmental message
